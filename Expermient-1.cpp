OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming approach based on the concept of objects — entities that contain data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.
It helps programmers organize and structure code in a more modular, reusable, and logical way.
 Definition:
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure programs in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions.
 Where OOP is Utilized
1. Software Development
Used to build desktop applications, mobile apps, and web applications.
Example: Java, C++, and Python applications all use OOP principles.
2. Game Development
Objects like players, enemies, weapons, and levels are represented as classes and objects.
Example: Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (C++) use OOP heavily.
3. GUI (Graphical User Interface) Applications
Each button, textbox, or window can be an object.
Example: JavaFX, Tkinter (Python), or .NET (C#).
4. Real-World Systems
Used in systems like banking software, hospital management, school management, etc.
Example: Classes like Account, Patient, or Student model real entities.
5. Web Development
Frameworks like Django (Python), Spring (Java), and Ruby on Rails use OOP concepts to organize code.
6. Embedded Systems
Devices like smart TVs, cars, or IoT systems use OOP-based languages like C++ for modular and efficient code.
7. Enterprise Applications
Large business systems (ERP, CRM, etc.) are built using OOP for scalability and maintenance
Let’s go through the **Concepts of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** in **C++**, with **detailed explanations and examples** — perfect for notes or exam preparation.
##  **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in C++**
C++ is one of the most widely used **object-oriented programming languages**.
It allows programmers to model real-world problems using **classes** and **objects**.
##  **1. Class and Object**
### ➤ **Class**
A **class** is a **user-defined data type** that acts as a **blueprint** for creating objects.
It defines **attributes (data members)** and **behaviors (member functions)**.
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;
    void showDetails() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << endl;
    }
};
```
### ➤ **Object**
An **object** is an **instance of a class** — it represents a real-world entity.
```cpp
Car c1;          // creating object
c1.brand = "BMW";
c1.speed = 200;
c1.showDetails();
```
 **Output:**
```
Brand: BMW, Speed: 200
```
---
##  **2. Encapsulation**
> Encapsulation means **binding data and methods** that operate on that data into one single unit (a class) and restricting direct access to the data.
It is achieved using **access specifiers**:
* `private` — accessible only inside the class
* `protected` — accessible in derived classes
* `public` — accessible from outside the class

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;

public:
    BankAccount(double b) { balance = b; }

    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }

    double getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

 **Explanation:**

* The `balance` is hidden (private).
* Access to it is only through `public` methods like `deposit()` and `getBalance()`.

 **Benefit:** Data security and controlled access.

---

##  **3. Inheritance**

> Inheritance allows one class to **inherit** the properties and behavior of another class.
> It promotes **code reusability**.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() { cout << "Eating..." << endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() { cout << "Barking..." << endl; }
};
```

```cpp
Dog d;
d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
d.bark();  // defined in Dog
```

 **Output:**

```
Eating...
Barking...
```

### **Types of Inheritance in C++**

1. **Single Inheritance** – One base, one derived
2. **Multiple Inheritance** – Derived class inherits from multiple base classes
3. **Multilevel Inheritance** – Inheritance chain
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** – One base, many derived
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** – Combination of two or more types

 **Benefit:** Reuse of code and extension of existing functionality.

---

##  **4. Polymorphism**

> **Polymorphism** means “many forms.”
> It allows the **same function name** to behave **differently** depending on the context.

### Types of Polymorphism in C++

#### ➤ **Compile-time Polymorphism**

(also known as **Static Binding**)

* Achieved using **Function Overloading** and **Operator Overloading**.

**Example (Function Overloading):**

```cpp
class PrintData {
public:
    void print(int i) { cout << "Printing int: " << i << endl; }
    void print(double f) { cout << "Printing float: " << f << endl; }
};
```

**Example (Operator Overloading):**

```cpp
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) { real = r; imag = i; }

    Complex operator + (Complex obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }
};
```

---

#### ➤ **Runtime Polymorphism**

(also known as **Dynamic Binding**)

* Achieved using **virtual functions** and **inheritance**.

**Example:**

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { cout << "Animal sound" << endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { cout << "Bark" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a;
    Dog d;
    a = &d;
    a->sound();   // Calls Dog’s sound() due to runtime polymorphism
}
```

 **Output:**

```
Bark
```
 **Benefit:** Flexibility and extensibility in code.
---
##  **5. Abstraction**
> Abstraction means **showing only essential details** and **hiding the background implementation**.
It can be implemented using:
* **Abstract classes (with pure virtual functions)**
* **Access specifiers**
**Example:**
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void area() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void area() { cout << "Area of Circle = πr²" << endl; }
};
```

 **Explanation:**
* The base class `Shape` defines a common interface.
* Derived classes like `Circle` must implement their own `area()`.
 **Benefit:** Focus on *what* an object does, not *how* it does it.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and methods together                           |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality |

| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Class & Object** | Blueprint and instance   | Code organization            | `class Car {}`                 |
| **Encapsulation**  | Data hiding              | Secure data                  | Private variables              |
| **Inheritance**    | Code reusability         | Relationship between classes | `class Dog : public Animal`    |
| **Polymorphism**   | Many forms of a function | Flexibility                  | Overloading, Virtual functions |
| **Abstraction**    | Hiding details           | Simplifies complexity        | Pure virtual functions         |
 **benefits of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming System)** — 
 **Benefits of OOP**
Object-Oriented Programming provides several advantages over traditional (procedural) programming.
It makes programs easier to **develop, maintain, and reuse**.
 **1. Reusability**
> Code written once can be used again and again.
* Achieved through **inheritance** — a new class can reuse features of an existing class.
* Saves time and reduces duplication.

**Example:**
```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    void start() { cout << "Starting vehicle" << endl; }
};
class Car : public Vehicle {}; // Car reuses Vehicle’s code
 **2. Modularity**
> The program is divided into small, independent units (classes).
* Each class handles a specific part of the program.
* Easier to **debug**, **understand**, and **maintain**.
 **3. Data Hiding (Security)**
> Sensitive data can be hidden from unauthorized access using **encapsulation**.
* Only public methods can access or modify private data.
**Example:**
```cpp
class Account {
private:
    double balance;
public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
};
``"
➡ Prevents direct modification of `balance`.
---
 **4. Extensibility (Code Maintenance)**
> You can easily add new features without changing existing code.
* Through **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, new classes can extend existing ones.
* Makes it easy to **upgrade** or **scale** software.
---
 **5. Abstraction**
> Complex systems can be simplified by showing only the essential details.
* Programmers can focus on *what* an object does, not *how* it does it.
* Reduces complexity in large projects.
---
 **6. Polymorphism**
> Provides **flexibility** by allowing one interface to represent many forms.
* A single function name can behave differently depending on the object.
* Makes code more **dynamic and adaptable**.
 **7. Easier Troubleshooting**
> Because of modularity, if a problem occurs, you can isolate and fix the specific class or object without affecting others.
---
**8. Real-World Modeling**
> OOP makes it easier to represent real-world entities like *students, cars, employees* etc., in code.
* This makes programs more intuitive and closer to real-world logic.

Each class handles a specific part of the program.
Easier to debug, understand, and maintain.
 3. Data Hiding (Security)
Sensitive data can be hidden from unauthorized access using encapsulation.
Only public methods can access or modify private data.
Example:
class Account {
private:
    double balance;
public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }

 8. Real-World Modeling
OOP makes it easier to represent real-world entities like students, cars, employees etc., in code.
This makes programs more intuitive and closer to real-world logic.

Result:
From the study of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we understand that it is a programming approach based on objects and classes.
It helps in organizing code efficiently by using concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
OOP improves reusability, security, flexibility, and maintainability of programs and makes software development more structured and closer to real-world modeling.
